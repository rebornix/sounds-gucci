# Issue #288910: Explicitly archiving all sessions from Sessions view context menu should not show dialog

## Description

I right-click and select archive all, it would be great to not show one more dialog because it's an explicit gesture and it's cumbersome to use the dialog. Especially since it's possible to "unarchive all".

I think we could add a "Do not ask again" checkbox.

Verify you get a checkbox to remember choice.
