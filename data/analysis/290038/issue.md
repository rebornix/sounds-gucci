## Description

Sometimes the chat initiated from the welcome page doesnt get passed to the workspace that is being opened. 

Tested a few flows and I think the issue is when the folder that is being opened has files open the chat message doesnt get passed. If I open a new window the previous message is prepopulated in the chat welcome view.
