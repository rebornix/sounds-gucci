# Issue #290793: Chat progress badge not useful and just distracts me

## Description

Right now we show a progress badge for chat that is running.

This badge is not useful to me and distracting:
* It does not mean I need to act on it
* My chat is almost always running when I use VS Code, which means I see this badge all the time
* I would prefer to see a badge if Chat asks for my input or I need to act on something

Lets ask around in the team, it was recently added and I like it because I do not see the command center.
